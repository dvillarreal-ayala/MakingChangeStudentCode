| April 5 |   9-10pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |

| Jan 29  | 11-11:30am |                                                                                                                                        Spent some time looking over notes and tried to think about how I would implement a recursive method, need to think about base cases. |
| Jan 29  |  8-9:15pm  | Started thinking about how to divy up the problem into smaller sections, and started considering between changing the number of coins i'm working with as I go thru or changing the target number. I figure I will need dynamic programming to make it work or be efficient. |

| Feb 3   |   2-3pm    |                                                                    Reorganized coin list to greatest to smallest. Started trying to implement recursive methods and need to clean up code, add the i-out-of-bounds base case, and then check to see if it passes test cases. |
